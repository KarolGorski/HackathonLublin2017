Android application using 3 APIs:
1. NextBike API
2. UMCS weather API
3. Google Maps API

User goes into our app and writes his start location and destination. Application suggest him to take bike if weather is ok, or to go by bus if it's cold or raining. User is redirected to bus timetable or to new instance of map where the shortest path to his destination is shown and he can see the nearest point to get bike and other points around his target to put borrowed bike down. 
Application has nice design too :D
